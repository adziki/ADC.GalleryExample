+#Welcome to my sample code base for *AnDevCon 2014*.
+
+This application is used to showcase the nuances of configuring your app to
+support as many devices as possible in an effective and efficient manner.
+
+This code base is a companion to my slides, located at: http://bit.ly/1fsE8bz
+
+##Structure
+This repo has three branches.
+
+/examples/one is the starting point for the first demonstration.
+- This demonstration starts out with a single layout file which leads to
+inconsistent UIs across different devices, sizes, pixel densities
+
+/examples/two is the starting point for the second demonstration.
+- Building off of the where the first example left off, the second demonstration encapsulates
+the sizing of your images into dimens files, and uses layout files for structures
+
+
+/examples/three is the starting point for the third demonstration.
+- This example extends the example to start using styles for managing your UIs
+as a means for minimizing the locations needed to modify and update your UI.
+The example will build out a Card View example around the images.
